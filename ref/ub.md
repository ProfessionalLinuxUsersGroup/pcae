# THIS IS A TEMPLATE DOCUMENT

(However, these are not hard fast templates, as long as the style is maintained
there is a degree of freedom.)

There is a larger degree of operational freedom allowed for unit bonuses.

However these bonus sections should be structured much like unit labs
and pertain directly to the unit they reside in, for example, a Unit 2
Bonus should present and build upon Unit 2 content.
